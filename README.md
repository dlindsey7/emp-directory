## Employee Directory
Frontend for the Employee Directory prototype.

## To Do List
There's a lot that can (and should) be added to this directory!<br>
Some of the improvements are listed here:
* Sort out cross domain error when running in production.
* Add functionality to the Add/Delete buttons.
* Styling!
* Setup a directory structure for files.
* Add in actual, thoughtful responsive design.
* Ensure the app works on more browsers than Chrome.
* Clean up dependencies.

## Available Scripts

From create-react-app, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
There are currently three tests to make sure the components are compiling.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
